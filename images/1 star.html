                    The plot centers on the investigation into the murder of Amanda Grayson, who is found dead at the bottom of her newly renovated home’s staircase. She was last seen attending an annual summer party during which couples swap partners in the upstairs bedrooms of a gorgeous brownstone. The novel, which is filled with titillating details — there are sex parties, blackmail and pornography — has been optioned for a TV series by Nicole Kidman, who was perhaps drawn to its similarities to “Big Little Lies.”

                <p style="font-size:20px;">
                    Portraying himself as a failure, the protagonist of Osamu Dazai's No Longer Human narrates a seemingly normal life even while he feels himself incapable of understanding human beings. Oba Yozo's attempts to reconcile himself to the world around him begin in early childhood, continue through high school, where he becomes a "clown" to mask his alienation, and eventually lead to a failed suicide attempt as an adult. Without sentimentality, he records the casual cruelties of life and its fleeting moments of human connection and tenderness.
